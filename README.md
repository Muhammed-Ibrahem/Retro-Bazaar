**In this challenge I practiced my HTML, CSS & JavaScript skills to make a `responsive landing-page`**

### **What I've Learned in this design**
1. Structure my html in appropriate way to make it easier to handle each section in the css
2. Improved my CSS skills by making a fully responsive page with most screen sizes
3. I practiced my SCSS and made use of SCSS variables and it's cool nested syntax, also making it autoprefix my css to make the page compatible with all browsers
4. On-scroll animation
5. I made my own small css-animation library to get the smooth animations I had on the page
6. I learned about Observers in JS and made them watch the elements I want to animate once I scroll to them
7. Learned how to make a smooth scroll effect from section to another using the easing functions in JS
